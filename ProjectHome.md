FRAM visualizer is a tool developed to help to model a model or accident with FRAM (Functional Resonance Accident Model). The tool helps to model the FRAM table and to visualize it.

The tool was originally developed during a course at Linköpings university by Peppe Bergqvist, Fredrik Gustafsson, Jonas Haraldsson and Gustav Ladén.

This project has been discountinued, if you wan't to take over this project, please email and I will arrange it.
During my masters project I made another application, that supports FRAM somewhat. You can find it at https://bitbucket.org/peppelorum/finit. It's coded in Python and QT and _should_ be a lot easier to continue than FRAM visualizer.
